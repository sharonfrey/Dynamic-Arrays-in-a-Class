# Call Stats 5 Objectives:
1. Read the contents of a data file one record at a time in a dynamic array       
2. Process the data that was read from the data file one record at a time, into a dynamic array       
3. Print the records in a dynamic array to a datafile using an ofstream object      
4.  Use the operator new to allocate memory for a dynamic array      
5.  Use the operator delete to de-allocate the memory allocated by the new (basically, making previously used memory available for use again)       
6.  Copy the content of one dynamic array into another dynamic array (basically, copying memory from one location to another)       
7. Be able to use the fstream library      
8. Be able to use a dynamic array of record records       
9. Be able to use an ifstream object       
10. Be able to use an ofstream object





# Call Stats 6 Objectives:
1.  Develop and use an ADTâ€™s to define a class to manage a dynamic array;       
2.  Use a default constructor to initialize the state of your class;       
3.  Use a destructor to de-allocate memory allocated using the new operator;
